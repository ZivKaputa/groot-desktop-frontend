# ACM@UIUC General Use Policy

## General

ACM is a shared space and must be kept clean and organized so that all members can benefit for the shared space. The ACM office is not your home, apartment, room, or dorm. Everyone is required as an ACM member to follow the rules outlined below and in other ACM policies. 

## Food and Cleanliness

Food is allowed in the ACM office, but every member is required to clean up after themselves and remind others to do the same. Anything, food or not, that cannot be immediately claimed to a member or event within a reasonable amount of time is subject to immediate disposal by the Officers.

More specifically, the cubbies are there for short term storage of personal materials. When working at a workstation of desk space, it is permissible to leave personal materials there for a short period of time (a bathroom break). It is not permissible to leave personal materials on workstations or desk space for longer periods of time (like a class period). When leaving for a longer period of time every member is expected to prepare the desk or workstation for the next person. If you want to store you material in the ACM during a longer period of time please use the cubbies. That said, do not store anything in the ACM for prolonged period of time without Officer approval. Anything deemed garbage will be disposed of.

## ACM Property

ACM property, which includes but is not limited to workstations, desks, books, chairs, devices, and cabinets, is to be treated with respect. If something breaks, please notify the Officers immediately. If there is any property which is not ACM's and is not claimed there are Lost and Found bins in the front office. The Lost and Found bins will be cleared at the Officers discretion, but at most every month.

Specifically for SIGs, there are cabinets in the Chapter Lab that are locked. These cabinets are to be used for valuables that a SIG wants to have locked. The other cabinets, including the Officer, Conference, and Admin cabinets are not to be used to store SIG items unless prior approval is obtained from the Officers or Admin. Most importantly, cabinets are not to be used for personal property. All property stored in ACM cabinets will be assumed to be ACM property.

## ACM Chapter Lab

The ACM Chapter Lab is a shared resource and its use is a privilege which can be revoked. The following policies will be enforced:
