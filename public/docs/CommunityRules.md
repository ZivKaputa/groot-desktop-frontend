# ACM@UIUC Community Rules

ACM@UIUC strives to be welcoming and open to anyone. We want our community to be inclusive and comfortable for all people, regardless of gender, ethnicity, or other cultural boundaries.

To that end, ACM@UIUC has adopted a set of rules that represent this initiative. Please consider these in all of your interactions in the ACM office, at ACM events, or amongst ACM members.
- Harassment of any individual or group will not be tolerated, especially based on gender, ethnicity, or other bias. There are no exceptions to this rule.
- Allow people to learn and grow by creating an environment where mistakes can be made. Here are some things to avoid:
	- No feigning surprise. "I can't believe you don't know what the stack is!”
	- No "well-actually” phrases. "Well, actually, you can do that without a regular expression.”
	- No back seat driving. Don't intermittently lob advice across the room.
	- No subtle sexism, racism, or other bias. "It's so easy my grandmother could do it.” is an example of a subtle comment that promotes ageism and sexism.
- Listen to and respect others while they are speaking.
- If you see bad behavior from others, speak up and support anyone who does the same.
If you have comments about these rules, please reach out to the ACM@UIUC Officers at acm@illinois.edu.

Thanks for helping to make ACM@UIUC a more inclusive and safe environment!
