# Cluster Acceptable Use Policy

## General

Please keep in mind that cluster resources are shared among all ACM members. The theme of this document is to respect other users and make sure the cluster remains an accessable resource for all ACM members. Please keep in mind that this document is not intended to list each and every rule that must be followed by cluster users. Ultimately, Admin and the Officers has the final say about what is and is not acceptable cluster usage. Failure to comply with any of these written rules or other rules conveyed by Admin or the Officers will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.

The ACM System Administrators, known as Admin, are responsible for maintaining the cluster and all related resources.  Admin can be reached via e-mail at userhelp@acm.uiuc.edu.  The Admin team is comprised entirely of volunteers, and is happy to respond to questions and requests.

## Expectations

ACM members are expected to adhere to the following policies when using our cluster, in addition to following the University Internet Policies:
- Cluster systems are for all ACM members, and any tasks that inhibit general use as deemed by Officers or Admin will be deleted, stopped, or removed
- There is no Service Level Agreement or uptime guarantee for any ACM systems or related ACM services. If something goes down, please notify the Officers or/and Admin
- Your account will be deactivated and removed when you are no longer affiliated with the University, and once data is deleted there is no way to get it back. Back it up if necessary
- Data on local machines in shared spaces is subject to deletion, without notification
- ACM Cluster privileges, like all other ACM privileges, can be revoked

## Policies

All University Internet Use and Workstation Use policies must be followed. Of note:
- Do not use ACM resources to attack any other machine, on or off campus.  This includes port scanning
- Do not use ACM resources to torrent, download, serve, or store illegal materials, copyrighted materials for which appropriate licenses have not been obtained, or pornography
- Do not use ACM resources for any commercial or illegal purpose
- Do not attempt to compromise the security of any ACM machine or service
- Do not attempt to misrepresent the origin of any communication
- Do not allow anyone else to use your ACM cluster account

## Workstations

The devices attached to ACM workstations are meant for those machines only; they should not be moved or borrowed without first receiving permission from Admin.  However, there are many other spare computer accessories that can be borrowed for short periods of time by members working in the ACM office.  These accessories should never be removed from the office without Admin or the Officers approval.  They should be returned to the location that they were taken from in the same condition that they were borrowed.  This ensures that other members are able to utilize the accessories in the future. Additionally, the various wall ports in the ACM rooms are not for personal use. Do not unplug any of the workstations.

Some of the equipment in the ACM office was purchased by one or more SIG.  This equipment is generally meant for use on a specific SIG project, and should not be used without first receiving permission from the SIG chair.
