/* How to write a program for ACMsh 
* 
* ACMsh runs on a single thread (thread) in the JS runtime
* This thread is controlled by a terminal state variable term_state
* ACMsh.exec() will set the term_state to EXEC, thereby giving control 
* of the thread to the program. 
* From this point you can use the console output by setting 
* terminal.textContent 
* or conduct other actions
* 
* Arguments to your program are provided in an array, quoted strings will 
* be treated as one argument
* 
* Before returning, call the ACMsh.return() to return control back to the shell
* If you need the console output to presist, pass a time in ms to the return function
* to delay turnover by.
